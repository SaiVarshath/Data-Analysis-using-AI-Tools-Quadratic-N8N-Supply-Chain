# üöÄ Data Analysis in Supply Chain with AI Tools (N8N & Quadratic)

This repository contains the files and outlines the technical architecture for an end-to-end data analytics project in the Supply Chain domain, leveraging modern AI-powered tools for data ingestion, storage, and analysis.

## ‚ú® Overview

The goal of this project is to solve a classic supply chain inventory problem for a fictional organic food manufacturer by building an automated, AI-powered analytics solution.

The solution demonstrates a modern data stack mindset by using no-code/low-code AI tools to automate complex tasks, from data migration to generating analytical insights. The key outcome is the calculation and analysis of critical Supply Chain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as **On-Time In-Full (OTIF)** performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Technologies & Concepts

| Category | Tool / Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Ingestion/Automation** | **N8N** | An AI agentic workflow automation tool used to monitor a specific email inbox, extract data from attached CSV/Excel files, and automate the migration process. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL (via Superbase)** | A relational database used to host the Fact and Dimension tables for structured data storage. |
| **Data Analysis** | **Quadratic** | An AI-powered spreadsheet (Python-enabled) used to connect to the PostgreSQL database, pull data, perform prompt-based data cleaning, table merging, and advanced analytics. |
| **Data Science** | **Python (Pandas)** | Code is automatically generated by Quadratic's AI for data manipulation, cleaning (handling dates, formats, white spaces), and calculations (e.g., currency conversion). |
| **Domain Expertise** | **Supply Chain KPIs** | Focus on calculating and explaining core metrics like **Line Fill Rate**, **Volume Fill Rate**, **On-Time Delivery**, **In-Full Delivery**, and the flagship metric: **On-Time In-Full (OTIF)**. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

The architecture automates the entire flow of data:

1.  **Data Source:** Sales data (two separate CSV files for aggregated orders and order line items) arrives via email attachments.
2.  **Automation Layer:** **N8N** is configured to monitor the email inbox, look for emails with a specific subject line, and process the attached files.
3.  **Data Storage:** N8N ingests the processed data into the **PostgreSQL** database (hosted on **Superbase**).
4.  **Analytics Layer:** **Quadratic** connects directly to the PostgreSQL database to pull raw data, then uses AI prompts to:
    * Create a clean Date Dimension Table.
    * Fetch and integrate daily **Currency Exchange Rates** (e.g., using `openexchange rates.org` API).
    * Merge Fact and Dimension tables into a final summary table (`Fact Summary`).
    * Calculate all required Supply Chain KPIs.
    * Answer complex business questions through charts and tables.

## üìà Key Analysis Performed

The analysis focuses on understanding and presenting the operational performance of the supply chain.

| KPI/Analysis | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **OTIF Percentage** | The most crucial metric, calculating the ratio of orders that were delivered **On-Time AND In-Full**. |
| **Fill Rates** | Separating performance into **Line Fill Rate** (lines delivered successfully) and **Volume Fill Rate** (quantity delivered successfully). |
| **Monthly Performance** | Tracking the trend of On-Time performance by city (e.g., New Jersey and various Indian cities). |
| **Customer Segmentation** | Identifying the top 5 customers based on order value and evaluating their corresponding service level (OTIF, In-Full, On-Time percentages). |

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

To replicate this project, you will need to set up accounts for the primary tools. Refer to the video description for links to the source files and the step-by-step PDF setup guide.

1.  **Get Source Files:** Download the sample India and USA sales data files (CSV) from the video description.
2.  **Set up PostgreSQL:** Create an account on **Superbase** to host your PostgreSQL database in the cloud and follow the guide to create the required Fact and Dimension tables.
3.  **Set up N8N:** Create an account on **n8n.io** (14-day free trial), configure a new workflow, and connect your Gmail credentials to monitor the data ingestion inbox.
4.  **Set up Quadratic:** Create an account on **quadratichq.com**, connect it to your Superbase PostgreSQL database using the connection string, and begin querying the tables.
5.  **Open Exchange Rates (Optional):** To perform the currency conversion analysis, you will need an API key from `openexchange rates.org`.
